This project is meant to simulate a DNS resolver. It starts by creating a Client object which requests a domain name from the user and then creates a request according to RFC 1035 to send to a DNS resolver. However becaue this is a simulation, it just givers the request to the Server object which will simulate a DNS resolver. The server object will then parse the request, get and get the website name. Then it will create a request and send it a a root server, it will time out after 10000 seconds. Then it will parse that response and continue to make and send requests until it reaches the authoritative server which it will have the HTTP IP address in the response. The server then sends that IP address to the client which creates a TCP connection and saves the response as an HTML file saved as the `website name.html`.

To run, run main file with python3 file.
